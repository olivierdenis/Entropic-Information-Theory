Olivier Denis' research has led him to question the fundamentality of the universe, seeking to explore the fundamental building blocks of reality. This pursuit has driven him to delve into the complex and multifaceted notion of quantum information. As a fellow Research Member of The Information Physics Institute, Denis has published several scientific articles in peer-reviewed journal, primarily focusing on Information Physics.

Denis' deep and detailed exploration of the notion of information allows him to explain various processes as informational phenomena. His published articles examine notions such as entropy, black hole entropy, black hole information paradox, gravitational black hole entropy, dark matter, dark energy, cosmological constant and stabilizatoin of traversable wormholes through the lens of quantum information.

These perspectives are unified in the Entropic Information Theory (EIT). EIT presents a novel approach to understanding the universe, focusing on the interplay between information, entropy, and physical phenomena. This theory posits that informational phenomena underlie fundamental aspects of the universe, including dark matter, dark energy, and the nature of quantum systems. By emphasizing the role of information and its entropic properties, EIT offers a unique framework for interpreting and linking various cosmic and quantum phenomena.

Moreover, EIT incorporates considerations being a possible "Theory of Everything", striving to provide a comprehensive framework that unites all fundamental forces and particles in the universe. By viewing the universe through the prism of information, EIT suggests that informational processes are the foundation of all physical phenomena. This perspective considered as possible "Theory of Everything" proposes that the universe's complexity can be understood as emerging from fundamental informational interactions.

Olivier Denis' work in Entropic Information Theory is at the forefront of contemporary scientific inquiry, challenging and expanding our understanding of the universe through the prism of quantum information and the Theory of Everything. His contributions offer profound insights into the informational nature of reality, paving the way for new advancements in physics and cosmology.
